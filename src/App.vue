          description: "SQL Injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries and perform operations in the database they are not authorized to perform normally. An example of a SQL Injection attack is modifying a query to retrieve additional information, such as modifying the order query to return all orders. The consequences of a SQL Injection attack include accessing unauthorised information, modifying or deleting data from the database, and logging into a more privileged user account. To prevent SQL Injection attacks, use placeholders or named place holders. If you have any questions or need further explanation, feel free to comment and share your knowledge."

          description: "Node.js is a powerful platform for creating fast and scalable applications, with its event-driven architecture being a key feature. The event loop is a continuous loop that handles asynchronous I/O operations in the application. It is designed to be non-blocking, allowing it to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the main thread. The event loop works by executing a continuous loop that checks for new events in the event queue. If no new events are found, the loop waits for new ones to arrive. The event loop operates on a single thread, allowing it to handle one event at a time. The event loop has four distinct phases: timers, pending callbacks, idle, prepare, and poll, check, and close."

These commands include Print Working Directory, List, Make Directory, History, Clear, Change Directory, Manual, Remove Directory, Create File, Concatenate, and Note. The pwd command checks the current directory, while the ls command lists files and directories within the current directory. The mkdir command creates a directory with various flags, and the history command provides a list of previously used commands. The clear command clears the terminal, and the cd command navigates the system. The man command provides a manual of a command, and the touch command creates a file."

          description: "The Linux command 'cat' is the simplest way to view the content of a file, as it outputs the entire content without providing input for scrolling. It can change access permissions of files using chmod and chown commands, with three types of owners: user, group, and others. The chmod command can be used to change permissions using symbolic mode or absolute mode. The 'history' command can check which commands have been run, and the 'rmdir' command can remove a directory/folder. A 'fruits.txt' file can be created by redirecting the output stream of the echo command to a file and viewing its content using the cat command. The 'devops.txt' file can be added with a list of fruits, and the 'head' command can show only the top three fruits. The 'tail' command can show only the bottom three fruits. A 'colors.txt' file can be created using the touch command and the cat command."
